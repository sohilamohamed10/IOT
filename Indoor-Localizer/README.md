# Introduction:
Indoor localization and tracking technology is becoming a fundamental element on several industries
including the warehouses, sports analytics, and biomedical applications.
Main requirement:
Design and implement a WiFi tracking module where a bracelet can be attached to an object and the
user can localize and track the current location of the object in real time through either a mobile
application or a website (note: The “or” is for the user not for the developer).

# Required features:
- The user can visualize a basic map for the location and see a flashing point moving on the map
representing the tracked moving object.
- The user can replay the motion of the object during the last time period (corresponding to like
50 time point). The replay path should be displayed in a different color. It up to your choice
whether the replay will be a different mode in your app or will run in parallel to the real-time
tracking mode. You just need to justify your choice.
- Pay a good attention for the boundary conditions. e.g. the tracked point should not be going
inside a wall or completely outside the map boundaries
